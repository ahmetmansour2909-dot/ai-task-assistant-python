##  AI Agent Logic
The AI Task Assistant uses a **rule-based intelligent agent** that analyzes task descriptions using keywords such as:
- **Priority keywords:** exam, project, meeting, deadline
- **Time keywords:** today, tomorrow, urgent
- **Category keywords:** study, work, personal

Based on these rules, the agent:
- Assigns priority dynamically
- Determines task category
- Explains the decision in a human-readable way
